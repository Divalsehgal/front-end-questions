# My DSA Observing Pattern

## The problem asks for a subarray/subsequence/substring.

### Sliding Window

#### Fixed Size Window
- Maintain a sum or count.
- Slide the window across the array.

#### Variable Size Window
- Use two pointers (`left`, `right`).
- Expand or shrink the window based on conditions.

### Two Pointer Technique

#### Two Sum
- Use `left` and `right` pointers to find pairs that sum to a target.

#### Three Sum
- Use three loops with `left` and `right` pointers.
- Skip duplicates using an object or a set.
