  this will make sure that script will download first from rest of the script 
  but it wont manipluate the execution order
 -->

<!-- 
     Async scripts are fetched asynchronously and executed as soon as they are downloaded,
         without blocking the parsing of the HTML or 
        waiting for other scripts or resources to download.
      -->

<!-- 
    Deferred scripts are guaranteed to execute in the order they appear in the HTML,
    after the HTML content is fully parsed but before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.
    They do not block the parsing of the HTML content
     -->

<!-- 
    Inline scripts are executed immediately as they are encountered during HTML parsing. 
     They don't block parsing or rendering of the page
